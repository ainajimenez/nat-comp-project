# Adaptive Chemotaxis in Spatially Constrained Environments

This project presents a hybrid model combining the Cellular Potts Model (CPM) and the Bacterial Foraging Algorithm (BFA) to simulate chemotactic behavior of cells in various nutrient landscapes, including static and dynamic gradients, multiple nutrient types, and spatial constraints such as obstacles. The goal is to study how simple chemotactic rules interact with physical constraints to influence swarm behavior and pattern formation.

## Repository Contents

### HTML Simulation Files
- **baseline_staticgradients.html**  
  Simulation with cells navigating static nutrient fields.

- **movinggradients.html**  
  Simulation with cells responding to moving nutrient gradients.

- **movinggradients_andobstacles.html**  
  Simulation with moving nutrient gradients and spatial obstacles.

- **2typesofgradients.html**  
  Simulation including two different cell types and two distinct nutrient fields.

### CSV Data Files
These CSV files were generated by the simulations (using an `exportToCSV` function) and contain cell and nutrient data recorded over time. They correspond to the first three HTML simulations:
- `base1.csv`, `base2.csv`, `base3.csv`
- `moving1.csv`, `moving2.csv`, `moving3.csv`
- `30moving_with_obstacles1.csv`, `30moving_with_obstacles2.csv`, `30moving_with_obstacles3.csv`
- `50moving_with_obstacles1.csv`, `50moving_with_obstacles2.csv`, `50moving_with_obstacles3.csv`

### Python Notebook
- **Project_Visualizations.ipynb**  
  This notebook loads the CSV data and generates various analyses and visualizations, including:  
  - Chemotactic Index (CI) distributions by condition  
  - Average distance of cells to nutrient peaks over time  
  - Mean Squared Displacement (MSD) to distinguish exploratory vs. directed movement  
  - Average cell speed over time, including during tumbles and under spatial constraints

## How to Use

- **HTML files:** To run the HTML simulation files locally, you need to have Artistoo available. Clone or download the Artistoo repository, then place the HTML files inside the artistoo-master/examples/html folder. After that, you can open the HTML files directly in your browser.

- **Python notebook:** To run the analyses, ensure you have the corresponding CSV files in the same directory as the notebook. Open `Project_Visualizations.ipynb` in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook) and execute the cells. The notebook automatically loads the CSV data and produces the graphs.

## Dependencies

- The HTML simulations require [Artistoo](https://github.com/ingewortel/artistoo) to run.
- The Python notebook requires standard data science libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.
